# ultrasonic_vacuum_cleaner
The device will be connected to the electrical network, so a 17 V AC/DC converter is needed. With this 17 V, the voltage doubler necessary to power the ultrasounds block will be powered. In addition, we use a regulator that goes from those 17 V to 12 V, to power the fan used to vacuum. We also use a 12V to 3V3 regulator to power the ESP32, with which we will control the fan through PWM; the RGB LEDs and the thermopile, with which we will estimate the temperature so that, if it is too high, we will warn the user with a red LED and a message via Bluetooth, in addition to automatically setting the fan to higher revolutions to dissipate heat. The fan control will be done with transistors and with PWM with the help of ESP32. What we are looking for is to control the Duty Cycle of the PWM signal to control the average voltage of the output, and thus, we will be able to manually set the fan to increase or decrease revolutions with a potentiometer as user requires.
